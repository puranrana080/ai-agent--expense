### ⚙️ **LLM + Tools = AI Agent**  
---

**🧩 LLM (Large Language Model):**  
An Artificial Intelligence (AI) system trained on massive amounts of text data, so that it can **understand, generate, and reason in human language**.  

---

**🔧 Tools:**  
External utilities or APIs that the AI agent uses to **perform real-world tasks**, such as fetching data, searching the web, running code, or interacting with external systems.  

---

✨ **Together**, the **LLM** provides the **intelligence**, and **Tools** provide the **action or functions** — forming a complete **AI Agent**.
